  "Lifelong learner, I made my first program when I was sixteen. It was a GCD calculator implementing an algorithm I had learned at school. I soon made my first website for my parent's music association using PHP/SPIP and HTML/CSS. When I moved to a big city to study, I realized how complex the world was and I wanted to understand it. So, I studied sociology and then became a teacher to share my passion for learning and nurture my student's curiosity. Iâ€™ve never given up on programming. In the meantime, I studied a bit of Java and C++. More recently, I fell into the AI and Python rabbit hole. After meeting one of my student's father, I realized that talking about computers made me feel very good, and I decided to turn what was a passion into a profession. I am now about to finish the 42 common core and am eager to start as a programmer."
